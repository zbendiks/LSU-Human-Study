# LSU-Human-Study
Scripts I used to process LSU metataxonomics and metagenomics data from human RS2 study

### Project Description
68 overweight [body mass index (BMI) ≥27 kg/m2] adults aged 35–75 y with prediabetes were randomized to consume 45 g/d of high-amylose maize (RS2) or an isocaloric amount of the rapidly digestible starch amylopectin (control) for 12 wk. Two fecal samples were collected from each subject at baseline and post-intervention (4 samples total) and frozen prior to DNA extraction. The 16S rRNA gene V4 region was amplified and sequenced for metataxonomics analysis. Additionally, high-quality gDNA from a subset of samples was submitted to NovoGene (https://en.novogene.com/) for metagenomic sequencing.
